I am 2nd year Ph.D. student at UC Davis, working with [Prof. Ambarish Kulkarni](https://kulkarni.ech.ucdavis.edu/). My research interests include Computational Catalysis, Molecular Simualtions, Accelerated Materials Discovery, and Rare-events Sampling. My current research focusses on developing Machine Learning potentials for studying adsorption and diffusion processes in Metal Organic Frameworks. Previously, I worked with [Prof. Zachary Ulissi](https://ulissigroup.cheme.cmu.edu/) during my Masters from Carnegie Mellon Univeristy (2019-20). My project was on designing high-performance Ionomers for fuel cells. I performed ab-initio simulations to study the interactions of nafion during ORR at the Pt interface.

I started out as an experimentalist and worked with different research groups ([Prof. Joao Crespo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wATwMVAAAAAJ&hl=en) & [Prof. Ranil Wickramasinghe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wsvSN_EAAAAJ&hl=en)) on Membrane Separations and Technology. I am also a proud alumnus of Indian Institute of Technology, Dhanbad. In my free time, I like to cook, explore new places, and read about new technological ventures.
